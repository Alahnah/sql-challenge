# sql-challenge
This challenge consisted of six csv files and was broken down into three parts:
  data modeling
  data engineering
  data analysis 

I used a lot of the in-class activities to help me with the primary keys, foreign keys, and group by analysis. For example, activity nine day three and activity four were used to help me set up my primary and foreign keys with the correct data types and form the correct relationships between tables. Day two activity five helped with the group by analysis when calculating the frequency count of last names, and filtering department names.
